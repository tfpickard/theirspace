# Contributing Guide

Thank you for building with this template. We prioritize **polished user experiences** and **production-quality engineering**.

## Principles

- **Design and UX matter**: ship delightful interfaces.
- **Performance is a feature**: track budgets and guardrails.
- **Accessibility is required**: keyboard + screen reader support.
- **Security is baseline**: validate inputs, guard endpoints.

## Development workflow

1. Create a feature branch.
2. Implement with tests and docs.
3. Run the test suite and linting.
4. Open a PR with clear context and screenshots for UI changes.

## Code standards

- Prefer **TypeScript** for JS/TS projects.
- Prefer **Python** for backend systems.
- Use **Bun or pnpm** for package management.
- Keep modules small and cohesive.

## Testing expectations

- Unit tests for logic.
- Integration tests for APIs.
- Playwright for UI flows.

## UI changes

Always include:
- Screenshot(s)
- Accessibility notes
- Performance considerations
