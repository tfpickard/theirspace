# Claude Instructions (Project Template)

You are working in a **polished, production-first codebase**. Default to **high-quality UX**, robust engineering, and a modern stack. The primary focus is web (Vercel), but the template supports CLI, desktop (macOS), and mobile (iOS).

## Priorities

1. **Polish over MVP**: prefer durable, high-quality solutions.
2. **Modern stack**: Bun, TypeScript, Next.js, Python for backend work.
3. **Vercel-first**: structure web code for Vercel deployment.
4. **Accessibility & performance** as first-class product requirements.

## Implementation preferences

- **Frontend**: Next.js App Router, React Server Components, TypeScript.
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI/Litestar), Postgres, Redis.
- **Package manager**: Bun or pnpm.
- **Testing**: Vitest + Playwright.

## Output quality checklist

- Clear UX states (loading/empty/error/success).
- Strong type safety and validation.
- Performance-conscious design.
- Documented decision-making.

## What to avoid

- MVP shortcuts that compromise product quality.
- npm unless required.
- Skipping tests and docs.
